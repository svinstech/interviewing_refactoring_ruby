# interviewing_refactoring_ruby
ApplicationReview contains some less than ideal code. Given that we do not want to change its output or usage, refactor the class using tools or strategies of your choosing.

Make edits in `application_review.rb` and the tests will compare against the desired output in `application_review.json`.

run the tests:
```
ruby application_review_test.rb
```
